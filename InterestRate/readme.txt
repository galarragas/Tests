The Problem:

A bank wants to introduce a new bank account with variable rates of interest depending on how much money is in the account.

The interest rate bands are as follows:

£0 to £1000 		 1%
£1000 to £5000 	 2%
£5000+		 3%

Write some code to work out the amount of interest someone should expect in pounds/pence for a given amount in the account.

For example: how much interest should I receive if I have £500 in the account (the answer is £5, i.e. 1% of £500).
